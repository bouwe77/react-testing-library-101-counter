# Testing React components with React Testing Library

Example app for learning to test React components with Jest and React Testing Library.

# Topics

- Introducing the topics
- Creating and running a test
- Jest watch mode
- What is rendered to the DOM
- Verify text is displayed
- Other ways of verifying elements: role, ..., etc.
- User interaction: clicking
- Verifying elements are NOT there
- Verifying elements within other elements (+ `screen.debug(element)`)
- Verifying elements after a rerender
- Debugging tips/tricks: `screen.debug`, Testing Playground, ...

Misc:

- App component needs to render something (temporary) to make screen.debug() more clear
- Use mocking, but don't explain it (yet)
